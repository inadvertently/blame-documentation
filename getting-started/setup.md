# Setup

## Setting up the Antinuke <a href="#antinuke" id="antinuke"></a>

Setting up the antinuke is fairly easy. We try not to over complicate it for the sake of simplicity and user-friendliness. For security precaution, only the server owner can enable the antinuke. You can enable it by using the `antinuke enable` command.

**Output:**

### Setting up antinuke limits

By default, the global antinuke limit is set to **two events** per **thirty seconds**. What does this mean? This means, your staff must have to complete **three dangerous actions in order for blame to penalize them**. We can change this by adding **custom limits** to **events/triggers** like so:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/an limit.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>This sets the <code>ban_members</code> event to 3 bans per 30 seconds.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### What does this mean?

This means that any `unwhitelisted` users cannot do more than `3` bans per `30 seconds`. If so, they will be penalized through blames antinuke. **For more information on the antinuke, look for the tab within our table of contents or click below**
