```
(embed)(title: welcome)$v(description: {guild.name})
```

#### 2. In this second example, we're going to welcome the user as up above, set their avatar as the thumbnail and add their username to the author.

```
(embed)(title: welcome)$v(description: {guild.name})$v(thumbnail: {user.avatar})$v(author: {user.name})
```
